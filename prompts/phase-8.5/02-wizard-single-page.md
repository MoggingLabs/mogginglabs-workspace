The one-page wizard (Phase-8.5/02). Three stepper screens (Start · Layout ·
Agents) become ONE scannable page: folder, grid, and agent lineup at once,
with 01's ramp giving every group real breathing room. AUDIT.md grades the
Agents screen **F** — 8 flat siblings, no cards, `padding: 5px`, four
control heights in one row, and the fill meter grouping upward toward the
subtitle instead of down toward its own controls. It gets the deepest pass.
All behavior (prefill, presets, per-slot profiles, swarm roles, remote
hosts, worktree isolation, tool plans, telemetry) is PRESERVED — layout
surgery, not a rewrite. AUDIT.md § Patterns carries the NN/g citation that
settles the format: wizards are wrong for repeated, expert, arbitrary-order
tasks. This is all three.

## Steps
1. **Structure** (`src/ui/features/wizard/index.ts`): drop
   `createWizardStepper` + the per-step render fns for one `render()`
   composing three `Card`s in one scrollable body — "Where" (folder +
   runs-on + name), "Layout" (grid picker), "Agents" (roster + quick-fill +
   assignment preview + meter). Each card uses `SectionHeader` +
   `FieldGroup` from 01; rhythm from `--sp-*`; the modal widens so one page
   never feels crammed. Footer: one primary `Launch N terminals` + ghost
   Cancel; the validation that gated Continue now gates Launch (folder
   unset → the Where card shows its hint and scrolls into view).
2. **Progressive disclosure inside cards**: rarely-used controls (remote
   host — one option for most users, per-slot profiles, swarm roles, tool
   plan, custom command, preset save/delete) collapse behind a quiet
   "Advanced" disclosure per card. Prefill and preset application
   auto-expand whatever they touch.
3. **The live summary**: the assignment preview stays THE at-a-glance truth
   (letter chips per pane). The launch label tracks `paneCount`; the fill
   meter regroups DOWN toward its own controls, not up toward the subtitle.
4. **Keyboard + audit removals**: Tab order top→bottom; Enter in the folder
   field jumps to Launch when valid; Escape confirms-then-closes;
   `wizard-port`'s prefill contract unchanged. Execute AUDIT.md's wizard
   REMOVEs: the `wizard:open` verb (twin of `workspace:new`, which also has
   the Ctrl+T chip — KEEP `setWizardOpener(open)`, that's the port), the
   layout preview+caption, the double footer divider, three empty-node
   spacers, the dead `EmptyState` import. Fix the `renderAgents()` self-call
   (`wizard/index.ts:818`) — it double-renders the screen.
5. **WIZARDUX smoke** (`MOGGING_WIZARDUX`, env-gated, qa-smokes.sh):
   (a) all three cards visible in ONE page (no `.wizard-stepper` in the
   DOM); (b) computed: card padding ≥ `--sp-4`, inter-card gap ≥ `--sp-5`;
   (c) prefill lands in all three cards at once; (d) launch opens the
   workspace with the chosen mix; (e) invalid folder → inline hint, no
   launch; (f) Advanced disclosures start collapsed and expand. Verdict
   `out/wizardux-result.json`. NOTE: `gallery.ts:272,275` clicks
   `.wizard-footer .btn--primary` — keep exactly one such descendant.

## Files
- `wizard/index.ts` · `global.css` (wizard block on tokens) ·
  `components/modal.ts` · `src/main/wizardux-smoke.ts` · main dispatch ·
  qa-smokes.sh row · gallery (both themes)

## Definition of Done
- One page, zero steppers; the wizard CSS block clears the § Enforcement
  grep (16 violations → 0).
- Every Phase-3..8 capability still reachable (worktrees, roles, profiles,
  remote, tool plan) — behind disclosures, not dropped.
- TEMPLATE_A/B, PRODUCT, BOARD gates still green; WIZARDUX green.

## Checks that must be green
- `npm run typecheck` → 0; build ok; boundaries clean.
- Full local sweep; PERCEPTION + MILESTONE re-run (renderer touched).

## Guardrails
- Layout surgery only: state model, channels, telemetry names unchanged.
- If one page cannot hold a 16-pane roster comfortably, the answer is
  disclosure depth — never a second screen.
